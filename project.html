										<h2>Prosthetic Finger and Thumb</h2>
										<p>Working in a group of 4, we were tasked with creating a prosthetic finger and thumb using simple gear mechanisms which included simple gear calculations. In addition to this, to ensure we were meeting our milestones, we had to utilize various project management tools, such as a Gantt chart, to maintain a schedule. Below you can see pictures of our design in AutoCAD Inventor and our finger and thumb 3D printed.</p>

									<h2>Writing Device</h2>
									<p>Working in a group of 4, we were tasked with creating a device to assist our client with their day to day life. They had a condition called dystonia, which prohibits a person from doing tasks for a prolonged period of time as certain body parts will start cramping. Our group created a prototype of a writing device that assisted with the client being able to draw and write easily. We utilized various project management tools, such as a Gantt chart to maintain a schedule and ensure that we were meeting all our deadlines. Below you can see a prototype of our design and a drawing of our prototype.</p>

									<h2>AutoCAD Design League</h2>
									<p>My team and I participated in a designathon, which is essentially a hackathon for AutoCAD. We created a drinking game, which was in the form of a water gun as shown below. It was able to shoot out both alcohol and alcohol filled popping boba and imitates Russian Roulette. We designed our drinking gun on AutoCAD Inventor and developed a simulation to present to the judges. Below you can see our design in AutoCAD Inventor.</p>

									<h2>HackWestern 9</h2>
									<p>My partner and I participated in a hackathon at Western earlier this year. We created a program that essentially makes it easier to search through medical articles and filter out various scales used in different medical papers. We were able to write out code in Python and our program searched through the articles based on key words such as ‘scale’. In addition to this, we made a prototype of our website that was very user friendly on Figma. To check out the code for our tool or our mock up on Figma, check out my 'hackwestern' repository on my Github!</p>
