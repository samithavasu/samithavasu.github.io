								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<div class="spotlight">
									<div class="content">
										<p>My name is Samitha and I am a third year Civil Engineering student at McMaster University. I am passionate about engineering and the environment and I am looking to work in either construction or structural design. I would eventually like to work in either construction or project management and get my P.Eng in the future. Aside from this, I am a passionate musician and dancer and love performing locally for various South Asian events. I am also an avid traveler and camper and try to do at least one camping trip a year with my friends!

										<p>As an aspiring engineer, my goal is to eventually work in construction or project management. Within these fields, I would like to find the most sustainable way to execute engineering projects. As we move into an era of recognizing the importance of the environment and the need to sustain it, it should be applied in our everyday work. The structural and construction sectors directly have an impact on the environment. Throughout my undergrad, I would like to not only gain the technical skills I need to work in these fields but I would also like to find out how to maintain sustainable practices in this field -- and I believe I can gain this insight through coop. </p>

								<h2>Extra Curriculars</h2>
								<p>At McMaster, I am a part of HerCampus McMaster, a journalism club that promotes blog writing to young women. Outside of McMaster, I am part of IronRing Girls, an online platform that helps empower women in engineering. This is in the form of Instagram, TikTok, and podcasts found on Spotify. I work as a part of the PR team and the social media team. Additionally, I founded the Student Chapter of HandiCare Intl, a charity organization that helps disadvantaged youth across Southern India. We host both in person and virtual events that have raised over $1500. Apart from these clubs, I have participated in an AutoCAD Designathon at McMaster and a Hackathon at Western University. You can read more about this in the Projects section!</p>

								<p>Aside from this, I am a performer. I have been a musician for the past 16 years and am quite passionate about it. I play the alto saxophone, clarinet, violin, keyboard and other electronic instruments. I have performed locally and online for the past 5 years. Along with this, I perform with a band locally for various South Asian events. I am also a dancer and have danced for the past 17 years and also perform locally for various South Asian events.
